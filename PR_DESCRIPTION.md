PR: Make peer creation server-driven (optional client fields) + tests

Summary
-------

This PR changes the VPN Peers API contract so that the frontend no longer needs
to provide WireGuard network details (wg_public_key, wg_ip, allowed_ips,
endpoint, dns). The backend will generate or retrieve these values depending on
the configured key policy (WG_KEY_POLICY) and will return a ready-to-use
configuration to the client on create.

What changed
------------
- `VpnPeerCreate` schema: `wg_public_key` and `wg_ip` are now optional. `device_name` optional field added.
- `VpnPeerOut` includes `wg_private_key` as Optional; private key is returned on create.
- Added POST `/vpn_peers/self` â€” create peer for authenticated user without passing user_id.
- GET `/vpn_peers/{id}` returns `wg_private_key` as null for security.
- `create_peer` updated to support WG_KEY_POLICY: `db`, `host`, `wg-easy`.
  - For `wg-easy`, the adapter creates a client and the server fetches the
    client configuration (wg-quick) and parses private key/address/allowed_ips.
- Unit tests added that mock host and wg-easy behaviors.

Security notes / risks
----------------------
- Private keys are sensitive. In this PR private keys may still be stored in DB
  (field `wg_private_key`). They are only returned to the client once (on
  creation). We must follow up with a decision:
  1. Encrypt private keys at rest (app-level encryption using a KMS-managed key); or
  2. Stop storing private keys server-side when possible (prefer client generation or wg-easy remote-only storage).

Recommendations
---------------
- Merge this PR to solidify the API contract.
- Create a follow-up task to implement option 1 or 2 from Security notes and
  to migrate/rotate existing keys.

Testing
-------
- Added unit tests that exercise db/host/wg-easy modes via mocks.

How to review
-------------
- Focus on `vpn_api/peers.py` for behaviour changes and `vpn_api/schemas.py` for contract changes.
- Tests: `vpn_api/tests/test_peers_api.py`.
